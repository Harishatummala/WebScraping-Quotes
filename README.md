🚀 I completed a straightforward web scraping project where I extracted data from the website Quotes to Scrape. The screenshot displays the code used, and the extracted data, saved in a CSV file.

👩‍💻 For an easier way to access and download web data in a structured format, Web scraping with Scrapy can help. Scrapy is a powerful and popular open-source web scraping framework for Python. It allows you to extract data from websites and process it as needed. Scrapy is known for its efficiency and flexibility.

Getting Started with Scrapy :-

Prerequisites:

🔸Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

🔸Basic Python Knowledge: Familiarity with Python programming is recommended.


Installation:

You can install Scrapy using pip. It’s best to do this within a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages:

◾ pip install scrapy

Creating a Scrapy Project :-

To start a new Scrapy project, use the following command:

◾scrapy startproject myproject

☝ this creates a new Scrapy project and a typical scrapy project file structure with the following

🔸spiders folder: This folder contains all of our future Scrapy spider files that extract the data.

🔸items: This file contains item objects that behave like Python dictionaries and provide an abstraction layer to store scraped data within the Scrapy framework.

🔸middlewares (advanced): Scrapy middlewares are useful if you want to modify how Scrapy runs and makes requests to the server (e.g., to get around antibot solutions). For simple scraping projects, you don’t need to modify middlewares.

🔸pipelines: Scrapy pipelines are for extra data processing steps you want to implement after you extract data. You can clean, organize, or even drop data in these pipelines.

🔸settings: General settings for how Scrapy runs, for example, delays between requests, caching, file download settings, etc.

Scrapy is used for a variety of applications, including:
🔸Data Mining: Extracting large amounts of data for analysis.

🔸Information Processing: Collecting and processing data for various uses.

🔸Historical Archival: Archiving web content for future reference 

Beautifulsoup, Selenium and Octoparse are the other Web Scraping tools widely used to extract data from websites.
